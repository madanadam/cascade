CASCADE Public License (CasPL)

This CASCADE Public License 1.0 (CasPL 1.0 for short) is based on the Simple
Public License (SimPL) 2.0 authored by Prof. Robert Gomulkiewicz of the
University of Washington School of Law. Modifications have been made to
prevent the commercial distribution (but not the commercial use) of the
software.

CASCADE Public License (CasPL) 1.0

The CasPL applies to the software's source and object code and comes with any
rights that I have in it (other than trademarks). You agree to the CasPL by
copying, distributing, or making a derivative work of the software.

You get the royalty free right to:

  - Use the software for any purpose;
  - Make derivative works of it (this is called a "Derived Work");
  - Copy and distribute it and any Derived Work solely for personal benefit
    and not for any commercial purpose or for monetary gain.

If you distribute the software or a Derived Work, you must give back to the
community by:

  - Prominently noting the date of any changes you make;
  - Leaving other people's copyright notices, warranty disclaimers, and license
    terms  in place;
  - Providing the source code, build scripts, installation scripts, and
    interface definitions in a form that is easy to get and best to modify;
  - Licensing it to everyone under CasPL, without adding further
    restrictions to the rights provided;
  - Conspicuously announcing that it is available under that license.

There are some things that you must shoulder:

  - You get NO WARRANTIES. None of any kind;
  - If the software damages you in any way, you may only recover direct damages
    up to the amount you paid for it (that is zero if you did not pay
    anything). You may not recover any other damages, including those called
    "consequential damages." (The state or country where you live may not allow
    you to limit your liability in this way, so this may not apply to you);

The CasPL continues perpetually, except that your license rights end
automatically if:

  - You do not abide by the "give back to the community" terms (your licensees
    get to keep their rights if they abide);
  - Anyone prevents you from distributing the software under the terms of the
    CasPL.
