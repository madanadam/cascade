1. Old Mitsubishi ECUs may need SCS to ground so they will talk to you.
Also, they need SCS toggled along with (or instead of?) the ignition to
reset.
2. If connection doesn't work, try turning ignition on earlier or later
(Honda).
3. Comm line indication is a hint, refer to manufacturer's wiring diagram
or try other lines if in doubt (Civic SRS etc.)
4. Most common problem: Wrong baudrate. Try all.
5. Fast-init is highly timing-critical; if it doesn't work, try again. (Can
be recognized by rapid flashing of break LED.)
6. If iface LED stays off and port stays at "none" in spite of plugged-in
interface, check if drivers are installed. (Should happen automatically with
Win7.)
